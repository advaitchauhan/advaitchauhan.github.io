Go placidly amidst the noise and haste... - Desiderata, *Max Ehrmann*

If you can meet with truimph and disaster, and treat those two imposters just the same...If you can fill the unforgiving minute, with sixty seconds worth of distance run... - If, *Rudyard Kipling*

It is not the critic who counts...The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the truimph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat" -*Teddy Roosevelt*
